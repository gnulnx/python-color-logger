python-color-logger 0.3.5
==============
The python-color-logger packages is a fork of logutils 0.3.3.
The original author of logutils is Vinay Sajip and his project 
can be found at:  http://code.google.com/p/logutils/

The logutils package provides a set of handlers for the Python standard
library's logging package.

The python-color-logger fork extends logutils to provide custom log 
coloring via sublcassing ColorizingStreamHandler.


Some of these handlers are out-of-scope for the standard library, and
so they are packaged here. Others are updated versions which have
appeared in recent Python releases, but are usable with older versions
of Python and so are packaged here.

Requirements & Installation
---------------------------
The python-color-logger package requires Python 2.5 or greater, and can be
installed with the standard Python installation procedure:

  python setup.py install
